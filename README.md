# Update Status to Create 0.6
Below are the Create add-ons in our modpack, as well as a few other changes to our modpack I am planning on making below the table here.

Mods marked with a `>` are the "essentials" we are waiting on.  Unmarked mods are considered non-essential, so we can update without those ones if necessary until they are made compatible with Create 0.6.

The "Status" is where I will maintain an up-to-date list of where we're at with each add-on:
- `UPDATED` means it is compatible with Create 0.6 in the current version.
- `ABANDONED` means it will likely not be updated, at least in the near future.
- `Waiting` means we are, well, waiting for it to be updated.
- `? ? ?` means I need to test if the add-on is compatible in its current version.
